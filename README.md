A collection of best practice examples for use by LIST team members.

 * A Git / GitHub initial setup guide - [set-up-GitHub.md]()
 * [Geospatial examples](Geospatial)
 * [SMRA examples](SMRA)

## Using the examples
The simplest (and recommended) way to use these examples is to copy and paste the code as needed, into your scripts.

## Contributing
This repository is publicly viewable but only members of the [LIST GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/Public-Health-Scotland/teams/local-intelligence-support-team-list) can interact with it. 

### Suggesting / Requesting an example
You can [open an issue](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/LIST-examples/issues) to suggest a topic/method, or even to post some code.

### Contributing code
Any new topic should have its own folder, and any scripts should be placed in that folder. Scripts should be as short as possible to illustrate the specific example.

You can contribute code through a Pull Request. A simple way to add a script is to use the [GitHub new file creation tool](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/LIST-examples/new/main), and paste your code into the box and add the folder name into the file name. For example to add a new script `random_forest.R` to a new folder `Machine_Learning`, you would give it the 'file name' `Machine_Learning/random_forest.R`.

If possible, add or update the `README.md` in the topic folder.
